# ME_ACS SQL Patcher

Windows desktop tool for patching MagEtegra SQL Server backup files (`.bak`) from one supported version to another.

## What This Repo Contains

- WPF desktop application targeting `.NET 8`
- SQL patch library under `patches/`
- xUnit test project covering patching, settings, and storage behavior
- Packaging and install scripts under `build/`

## Core Workflow

1. Select a source `.bak` file.
2. Choose the starting version.
3. Let the app resolve the latest reachable target version.
4. Run the patch workflow against a local SQL Server instance.

Default SQL target is `.\\MAGSQL`.

The app now treats the install folder as read-only runtime content. Settings, logs, backups, imported patch packs, and the active patch library live under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MagDbPatcher\...` so manual app upgrades do not wipe teammate state.

## Development

### Requirements

- Windows
- .NET SDK 8.x
- Local SQL Server instance (Express, LocalDB, or full SQL Server)
- Permissions to restore, back up, create, and drop databases

### Build

```powershell
dotnet build ME_ACS_SQL_Patcher.sln
```

### Test

```powershell
dotnet test ME_ACS_SQL_Patcher.sln
```

## Packaging

Create a smoke-test publish folder and versioned handoff ZIP with:

```powershell
.\build\package.ps1
```

Create the full release set, including the Velopack installer artifacts, with:

```powershell
dotnet tool restore
.\build\release.ps1
```

`build\release.ps1` produces:

- `output\` for local verification
- `dist\ME_ACS_SQL_Patcher-<version>.zip` for manual handoff
- `dist\installer\` with installer/update artifacts such as `ME_ACS_SQL_Patcher-win-Setup.exe`
- `dist\release-manifest.json` describing the release outputs

`build\package.ps1` still produces:

- `output\` for local verification
- `dist\ME_ACS_SQL_Patcher-<version>.zip` for manual handoff

Default packaging is self-contained single-file `win-x64`, so target machines do not need a separate .NET runtime installation.

Install the published build locally with:

```powershell
.\build\scripts\Install-Portable.ps1
```

By default the install script uses `output\` as its source and installs the EXE under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MagDbPatcher\app`. If the source folder contains legacy portable `settings.json`, `logs\`, `backups\`, or `patches\`, the script carries them forward into the managed LocalAppData layout when missing.

## Support Handoff

For a manual teammate handoff:

1. Build the release with `.\build\release.ps1`.
2. Send either `dist\installer\ME_ACS_SQL_Patcher-win-Setup.exe` or `dist\ME_ACS_SQL_Patcher-<version>.zip`.
3. Teammates install once, then run the app from the installed location.
4. Future app updates are manual by default: replace the installed app with the next release package.
5. Optional LAN-hosted prototype: publish `dist\installer\` into `update-host\feed` and point installed clients to that UNC path for internal update checks.
6. Future SQL content updates should be delivered as patch packs whenever possible.

Installed runtime layout:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\MagDbPatcher\
  app\                     installed app binaries
  settings.json
  logs\
  backups\
  patches\                 active patch library used by the app
  patch-packs\             archived imported patch packs
```

Runtime notes:

- `app\patches\` is only the bundled baseline library that ships with the app.
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MagDbPatcher\patches\` is the active patch library used at runtime.
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MagDbPatcher\backups\` stores patch-library rollback backups created during patch-pack import.
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MagDbPatcher\patch-packs\` stores imported patch pack ZIPs for traceability.
- Temporary restore workspace is stored in `%ProgramData%\ME_ACS_SQL_Patcher\temp`.

## Patch Updates

The normal workflow is:

1. Ship a full app release for binary/UI/runtime changes.
2. Ship a patch pack ZIP for new SQL scripts and patch-library-only changes.
3. If you want to test PC-hosted app updates on your office network, use the scripts in `update-host\` and share that feed folder from your machine.

The application supports importing a patch pack ZIP with this structure:

```text
MagPatchPack.zip
  patch-pack.json
  patches/
    versions.json
    patcher.config.json
    <version folders...>/*.sql
```

Create a patch pack with:

```powershell
.\build\tools\New-PatchPack.ps1 -PatchesFolder .\patches -PackVersion 20260203 -OutFile .\MagPatchPack.zip -Notes "7.2.3 build patches"
```

After a patch pack import, the app validates the ZIP, swaps the active patch library atomically, stores a rollback backup, and archives the imported ZIP under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MagDbPatcher\patch-packs\`.

See [PATCH_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md](build/PATCH_OPERATOR_GUIDE.md) for the operator workflow when adding a new SQL script or version.

## CI

GitHub Actions is configured to restore, build, and test the solution on Windows for pushes to `main` and pull requests.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Suggested action |
| --- | --- |
| App does not open | Run the installed `ME_ACS_SQL_Patcher-win-Setup.exe` again or reinstall from the latest release |
| Missing runtime error | Rebuild using `.\build\release.ps1` or `.\build\package.ps1` in self-contained mode |
| Startup says package is incomplete | Verify the bundled `app\patches\versions.json` exists in the published output |
| SQL Server not found | Install SQL Server Express or LocalDB |
| No upgrade path | Verify `versions.json` and patch definitions |
| Version list looks wrong | Check the managed active patch library under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\MagDbPatcher\patches` or the configured custom folder |
